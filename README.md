PPhotogenix is photography multipage website. Creating separate pages can help keep from overloading site without losing information site visitors may find relevant.

The website starts with what Photogenix is all about, ending with map with location of the company and contact form for interested site visitors to get more information. The rest of the website is extremely clean. It tells the reader the services they can expect from the company, and customer testimonials to make everything more legitimate.
